Don't want to use a required server resource pack? Eat it!<p>
This mod adds a new button that will silently reject a required server resource pack, then tell the server that you
accepted it when you really didn't.   
You can also set this as the default pack policy in the server info screen.<p>

You can even hold shift when pressing the button to open the pack download link in a browser!<p>
